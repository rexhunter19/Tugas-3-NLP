# Tugas-3-NLP
Tugas Project 3 (Voice Recognition)
Objective:
The primary goal of this task was to evaluate the performance of a voice recognition model using the MInDS-14 dataset. This dataset is a comprehensive collection of multilingual conversational data, making it an ideal choice for training and testing voice recognition systems. The focus was on understanding the model's ability to accurately transcribe spoken language into text.

Dataset:
The MInDS-14 dataset consists of various conversations in 14 different languages. Each audio sample is paired with its corresponding transcript, providing a rich resource for training and evaluating voice recognition models. The dataset was split into training, validation, and testing subsets to ensure a robust evaluation of the model.

Model & Preprocessing:
The experiment involved selecting a state-of-the-art voice recognition model, capable of handling the diversity and complexity of the MInDS-14 dataset. Preprocessing steps included noise reduction, normalization, and feature extraction to prepare the audio data for the model. The model was trained on the preprocessed dataset, optimizing it for accurate transcription.
